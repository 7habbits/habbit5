    <p class="headline">The Habit of Empathic Communication</p>
    <div class="text1">
      <p>
        Communication is the most important skill in life. You spend years
        learning how to read, write, and speak. But what about listening? What
        training have you had that enables you to listen so you really, deeply
        understand another human being? Probably none, right?
      </p>
      <p>
        If you’re like most people, you probably seek first to be understood;
        you want to get your point across. In doing so, you may ignore the other
        person completely, pretend that you’re listening, selectively hear only
        certain parts of the conversation or attentively focus on only the words
        being said, but miss the meaning entirely. So why does this happen?
      </p>

      <p>
        Because most people listen with the intent to reply, not to understand.
        You listen to yourself as you prepare in your mind what you are going to
        say, the questions you are going to ask, etc. You filter everything you
        hear through your life experiences, your frame of reference. You check
        what you hear against your autobiography and see how it measures up.
        Consequently, you decide prematurely what the other person means before
        they finish communicating. Do any of the following sound familiar?
      </p>

      <p>
        You might be saying, “Hey, wait a minute. I’m just trying to relate to
        the person by drawing on my own experiences. Is that so bad?” In some
        situations, autobiographical responses may be appropriate, such as when
        another person specifically asks for help from your point of view or
        when there is already a very high level of trust in the relationship.

      <p class="text2">
        Because you so often listen autobiographically, you tend to respond in
        one of four ways:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Evaluating: You judge and then either agree or disagree.</li>
        <li>Probing: You ask questions from your own frame of reference.</li>
        <li>Advising: You give counsel, advice, and solutions to problems.</li>

        <li>
          Interpreting: You analyze others’ motives and behaviors based on your
          own experiences.
        </li>
      </ul>

        “If I were to summarize in one sentence the single most important
        principle I have learned in the field of interpersonal relations, it
        would be this: Seek first to understand, then to be understood.”
